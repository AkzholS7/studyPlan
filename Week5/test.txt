I tested my JDBC connection in 2 ways. 

1) - I added data of one more customer like below:
   
     String  query = "INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS(id, name, phonenumber) VALUES(5,'Arzymat', 0779858216)";
            Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
            statement.execute(query);
            System.out.println("Added one customers's data");

// at the result I got 5th row added. Actually  there were 4 rows on my customers table.



2) -  I deleted that row which I added before using the method written below:

    String query2 = "Delete from customers where id = 5";
            Statement statement1 = connection.createStatement();
            statement1.execute(query2);
            System.out.println("Deleted the last row in cutomers table");

// at the result the number of rows in customers table became as previously(4rows again);

So, testing was successfull.
